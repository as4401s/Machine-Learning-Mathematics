## Formulas with NumPy Implementations

Throughout the notebooks, several key formulas are presented. Here are some of the fundamental ones along with their NumPy implementations:

- **Dot Product**  
  The dot product of two vectors **a** and **b** can be computed using NumPy's `dot` function:

  ```python
  import numpy as np

  a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
  b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
  dot_product = np.dot(a, b)

Frobenius Norm
The Frobenius norm of a matrix A is calculated using numpy.linalg.norm:


import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
frobenius_norm = np.linalg.norm(A, 'fro')

Matrix Multiplication
Matrix multiplication of A and B can be performed using the @ operator or numpy.matmul:


import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
product = A @ B  # or np.matmul(A, B)

Matrix Inversion
The inverse of a matrix A is computed using numpy.linalg.inv:

import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
inverse_A = np.linalg.inv(A)

Eigenvalue Equation
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a square matrix A are obtained using numpy.linalg.eig:

import numpy as np

A = np.array([[4, 2], [1, 3]])
eigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eig(A)

Determinant of a Matrix
The determinant of a matrix A is calculated using numpy.linalg.det:

import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
determinant = np.linalg.det(A)

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
The Singular Value Decomposition of a matrix A is performed using numpy.linalg.svd:

import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
U, D, Vt = np.linalg.svd(A, full_matrices=False)
Here, U and Vt are orthogonal matrices, and D is a vector containing the singular values. To construct the diagonal matrix D:

D_matrix = np.diag(D)
